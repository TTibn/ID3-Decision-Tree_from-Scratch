# ID3-Decision-Tree-
ID3 Decision Tree Implementation

This project is part of a postgraduate Engineering course in Machine Learning and concerns Decision Trees.

The parameters of the project are as follows:

A)Implement a decision tree learner from scratch based on the ID3 algorithm
  –Programming language of your choice (in case of Python selected, don't include scikit-learn imports)
  –Interface of your choice
B)Implement 3 different splitting functions:
  –Random
  –Information gain
  –Gain ratio
C)Your program should be able to:
  –read the UCI Car Evaluation dataset
  –provide the following evaluation methods:
    •Holdout (p% for training (1-p)% for test)
    •10-fold cross-validation
