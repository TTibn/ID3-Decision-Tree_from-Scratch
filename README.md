# ID3-Decision-Tree-
ID3 Decision Tree Implementation

This project is part of a postgraduate Engineering course in Machine Learning and concerns Decision Trees.

The parameters of the project are as follows:

1) Implement a decision tree learner from scratch based on the ID3 algorithm
   a) Programming language of your choice (in case of Python selected, don't include scikit-learn imports)
   b) Interface of your choice
2) Implement 3 different splitting functions:
   a) Random
   b) Information gain
   c) Gain ratio
3) Your program should be able to:
   a) read the UCI Car Evaluation dataset
   b) provide the following evaluation methods:
      b.1) Holdout (p% for training (1-p)% for test)
      b.2) 10-fold cross-validation
